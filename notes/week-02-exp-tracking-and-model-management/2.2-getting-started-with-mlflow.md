# 2.2 Getting started with MLflow

Usefule commands:


- `pip list` to list all packages installed with pip
- `mÌ€lflow` - to get access to mlflow cli
- `mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db` to launch mlflow ui. This is basically telling mlflow that we want to store all the artefacts and metadata in sqllite. This is one of the alternatives for the backend.
