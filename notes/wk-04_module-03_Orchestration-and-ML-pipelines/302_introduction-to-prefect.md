# Introduction to Prefect

In this section, we are going to see how to convert a regular python code into a prefect script. We are going to run on our own prefect server locally and run some script against the server.

Goals for this section are:
- Clone github repository
- Setup a conda environment
- Start a Prefect server
- Run a Prefect flow
- Checkout Prefect UI
